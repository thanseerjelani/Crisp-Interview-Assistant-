- **Smart Information Collection**: Interactive chat-based data gathering for missing fields
- **Structured Interview**: 6 progressively challenging questions (2 Easy → 2 Medium → 2 Hard)
- **Timed Responses**: Auto-submit with difficulty-based timers (Easy: 20s, Medium: 60s, Hard: 120s)
- **Real-time Evaluation**: Intelligent scoring with detailed feedback
- **Session Persistence**: Seamless resume capability with Welcome Back modal

### Interviewer Dashboard

- **Candidate Management**: Sortable list with search functionality
- **Detailed Analytics**: Complete interview transcripts, Q&A breakdowns, performance summaries
- **Score Visualization**: Color-coded badges and percentage-based metrics
- **Contact Access**: Quick view of candidate information

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Intelligent Question Generation System

The application implements a sophisticated multi-tier question generation approach:

**Tier 1: API Integration**

- Supports OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude APIs
- Dynamic question generation based on difficulty and context
- Avoids repetition by tracking previously asked questions

**Tier 2: Curated Question Bank**

- Hand-crafted questions covering React, Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript
- Difficulty-calibrated with real-world scenarios
- Ensures interview quality even without API access

**Tier 3: Smart Selection Algorithm**

```typescript
- Filters out previously asked questions
- Randomizes selection to maintain variety
- Falls back gracefully across tiers
```

### Advanced Answer Evaluation

**Multi-factor Scoring Algorithm**:

- **Content Analysis**: Word count, depth of explanation
- **Technical Accuracy**: Presence of code examples, technical terminology
- **Completeness**: Coverage of key concepts
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Scores weighted by question complexity

**Evaluation Factors**:

```
Base Score (40%) - Answer length and structure
Technical Terms (30%) - Domain-specific vocabulary
Code Examples (30%) - Practical implementation knowledge
```

### State Management Architecture

- **Redux Toolkit**: Type-safe state management
- **Redux Persist**: Automatic localStorage synchronization
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of persistence failures

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai-interview-assistant

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file (optional - works without API keys)
echo "VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Resume Parsing Pipeline

```typescript
PDF → pdfjs-dist → Text Extraction
DOCX → mammoth → HTML → Text Extraction
Text → Regex Patterns → Structured Data (Name, Email, Phone)
```

**Extraction Patterns**:

- Email: RFC 5322 compliant regex
- Phone: International format support
- Name: Multi-pattern matching with validation

### Interview Flow State Machine

```
IDLE → UPLOADING → COLLECTING_INFO → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
       ↓
    [Resume Parsed]
       ↓
    [Info Validated]
       ↓
    [Questions Generated]
       ↓
    [Answers Evaluated]
       ↓
    [Summary Created]
```

## 🎨 Technology Stack

**Frontend**:

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit + Redux Persist
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- Vite (Build Tool)

**AI Integration**:

- OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 (Primary)
- Fallback system with intelligent evaluation

**File Processing**:

- pdfjs-dist (PDF parsing)
- mammoth (DOCX parsing)

**State Persistence**:

- localStorage via Redux Persist
- Automatic rehydration on load

## 🧪 Key Design Decisions

### Why Intelligent Fallbacks?

During development, API access constraints led to creating a robust fallback system that:

- Maintains interview quality without external dependencies
- Demonstrates algorithmic thinking and evaluation logic
- Ensures 100% uptime regardless of API status
- Provides a foundation for easy API integration

### State Management Choice

Redux Toolkit chosen for:

- Type-safe actions and reducers
- Built-in persistence support
- DevTools integration for debugging
- Scalable architecture for future features

### Component Architecture

- **Presentational/Container pattern**: Clean separation of logic and UI
- **Custom hooks**: Reusable business logic (useTimer, useInterview)
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful failure handling
- **Lazy loading**: Performance optimization for large components

## 🔍 Testing & Quality Assurance

**Manual Testing Checklist**:

- ✓ Resume upload (PDF/DOCX, invalid files)
- ✓ Information extraction and collection
- ✓ Complete interview flow (all 6 questions)
- ✓ Timer functionality and auto-submit
- ✓ Score calculation accuracy
- ✓ Persistence across page refreshes
- ✓ Welcome Back modal for unfinished sessions
- ✓ Dashboard search and sort
- ✓ Candidate detail view completeness
- ✓ Mobile responsiveness

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **Memoization**: React.memo for expensive renders
- **Debouncing**: Search input optimization
- **Local State**: Redux only for shared state
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based chunks

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- Export candidate data to CSV/PDF
- Email notifications for completed interviews
- Multi-role interview templates
- Video interview recording
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Candidate comparison tools
- Custom question bank management

## 📝 Development Notes

### API Integration

The codebase is structured for easy API integration. To add a new AI provider:

```typescript
// In src/services/openai.service.ts
static async generateQuestion() {
  // Try primary API
  if (primaryAPI) return await primaryAPI.generate();

  // Try secondary API
  if (secondaryAPI) return await secondaryAPI.generate();

  // Fallback to question bank
  return this.getFallbackQuestion();
}
```

### Evaluation Algorithm

The fallback evaluation uses a weighted scoring system:

```typescript
Score = (
  BaseScore(wordCount) × 0.4 +
  TechnicalTerms × 0.3 +
  CodeExamples × 0.3
) × MaxScore
```

This ensures fair and consistent evaluation regardless of API availability.
